## JS

### Variables
ES6 introduced new type of variables for JS

#### Let
Variables created with the `let` keyword allows scripts restrict access to the variable to the nearest enclosing block.

#### Const
Variables created with the `const` keyword are a read-only reference to a value and cannot be reassigned.

### Functions
Normally a JavaScript function is declared like this
```js
function test() { }
```

#### Lambda Functions
In ES6 it's possible to create lambda/arrow functions like this
```js
() => { }
```
